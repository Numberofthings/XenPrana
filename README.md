Xen Prana: A Virtual Deposit Contract with Stable Smart Contract Mechanism



Introduction:

Xen Prana is a virtual deposit contract built on the EVM blockchain networks. It utilizes a stable smart contract mechanism called Prana to enable users to deposit and earn rewards in the form of liquid XEN tokens. The smart contract has been designed to ensure stability and transparency, with rewards distributed to Prana token holders.



How It Works:

Users can deposit XEN tokens into the Xen Prana smart contract by calling the deposit function. When a user calls the buy function, a 5% fee is taken from their deposit, which is then distributed among Prana token holders. The amount of Prana tokens a user holds determines their share of the overall fee distribution. Rewards are distributed in liquid XEN tokens.

Similarly, a 5% fee is taken from the user's deposit when they call the sell function, which is also distributed among Prana token holders. In addition, 5% of the user's initial deposit is burned by calling the burn function in the original XEN smart contract.



Prana Smart Contract Mechanism:

The Prana smart contract mechanism is designed to ensure stability and prevent fluctuations in price. When users interact with the smart contract, the price of Prana tokens does not go up or down. Instead, dividends are simply distributed to Prana token holders.

This ensures that even if a whale dumps a large amount of Prana for XEN, Prana holders will not lose token value. They will simply receive dividends in the form of liquid XEN tokens.

Users can choose to withdraw the liquid XEN back to their wallets or reinvest it back into the contract to increase their share of Prana and thus their potential rewards.



Benefits:

Xen Prana offers several benefits to users, including:

Stable Smart Contract Mechanism: The Prana smart contract mechanism ensures stability and prevents fluctuations in value, making it an attractive option for users looking to minimize risk.

Transparent Fee Distribution: Fees charged on each transaction are distributed among Prana token holders, ensuring transparency and fairness.

Reduced XEN Supply: A portion of the initial deposit is burned to reduce the overall supply of XEN tokens, which can lead to an increase in the value of the remaining tokens.



Conclusion:

Xen Prana is a virtual deposit contract that offers users a stable smart contract mechanism to earn rewards in the form of liquid XEN tokens. With transparent distribution of fees and dividends, users can deposit with confidence, knowing that their rewards will be distributed fairly. 

The Prana smart contract mechanism ensures stability and prevents price fluctuations, making Xen Prana an attractive option for users looking to earn rewards while minimizing risk. There is no dev fee, no founder allocation or pre-mine and the smart contract is immutable.
